# Themes for green new york
* what is building public renewables, and how is it better than ConEd? Relate it to BRPA bill, DSA slate of candidates that support it
* How much money does ConEd/Big Oil Energy companies give to ny politicians? Relate it to our grassroots campaigns in ny
* How did we stop the Astoria peaker plant? Relate it to our organizing skills, direct action, and protestors


All of these topics overlap, and we can all connect them to 
* BRPA and the Democratic Power Act
* Our grassroots, small donations, socialist candidates, and their platforms
* Results that we have delivered, such cancelling the astoria plant, or direct action, like on 3rd Ave

Goals
* Describe specific policies in Green New York
* Show concrete actions or bills that can forward green new york
* show how DSA is at the forfront of the movement
* Show our candidate slate, their platform, and how they will push GNY through
